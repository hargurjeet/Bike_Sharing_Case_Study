## General Information
- ### Business Problem
> BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is thinking of way to improve its revneues once the pendamic ends and the economy restores to a healthy state.

> BoomBikes inpires to understand the driving factors that could make an impact in increasing of their revenues which in term mean they want to understand factors that impacts the ride sharing business. They have gathered large data on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

- ### Proposed Solution
> Developing a machine learning model that can predict the demand of shared ride based on key driving factors.

- ### About Dataset
> - The dataset contains 700+ records providing the details of rides
> - The Features contains weather, tempeature, season, holiday, humidity...etc.

## Conclusions
- Rides sharing are seasonal,their are high rides sharing on summer and fall as compared to other season.
- The trend of Rides sharing is picking and Year on year there is increase in ride sharing.
- The is not much variation observed on ride sharing on weekdays or working day and weekends.
- Rides sharing is towards the higher side when the weather is clear.
